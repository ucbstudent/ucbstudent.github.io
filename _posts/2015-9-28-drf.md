Dominant resource fairness is concerned with scheduling tasks in a cluster
shared among multiple users in such a way that "fairly" divides resources while
achieving high utilization.  Of course, once one decides to do something
fairly, one must then describe what "fair" means in this context.  The most
important contribution of the paper, is a recognition that the traditional
definitions of fairness should be amended to include a concept called "strategy
proofness" where users cannot game the system by getting unfairly favorable
allocations by lying.  This is very interesting as it obviates the need to
detect and counteract cheaters by completely removing their incentive to do so.  
I suspect the impact of this contribution, and the resulting algorithm (DRF),
will be broad and sustained for some time to come.
