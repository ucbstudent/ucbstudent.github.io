Mesos is concerned with scheduling short data processing tasks on a cluster of
servers.  I think the key insight here is that we should decouple compute
scheduling from the application.  In traditional big-data systems, these two
concepts were tightly coupled.  For example, in Map-Reduce, you had a set of
mappers and a set of reducers which ran on separate servers leading to
unbalanced clusters which could be under-utilized.  Rather than trying to
schedule resources optimally on a per-system basis (as had been the norm),
Mesos argues we should solve it once in a framework.  As an added side
benefit, this implies that multiple services (Hadoop, Spark, Stream Processors,
etc) could all run on the same cluster seamlessly.

I think the recognition that we should separate applications from resource
management is fundamental and the primary contribution of the paper.  The
precise way they went about achieving it, i.e. resource offers, seems like a
reasonable enough solution to the details of scheduling, but one could imagine
alternatives which would work just as well.  I doubt resource offers will be
particularly influential in the long term, but Mesos certainly will.
