Technically speaking I don't think there's all that much new here.  Using Paxos
to guarantee consistency a consistent ordering for transactions, geo
replication, and time synchronization are tricks as old as distributed systems
research.  That said, I still found the paper quite interesting, not so much
for it's research contributions, but as an existence proof of a scalable ACID
database.  I've always thought that the tradeoff high performance relaxed
consistency NoSQL stores, and strongly consistent SQL is a false one with most
of the gains coming from better engineering than a theoretical advantage.  I
think this paper adds evidence to this point of view.

One issue I see with this is getting it to work outside of a tightly controlled
datacenter.  Google likely has dedicated fiber with high SLAs between its
datacenters meaning it can guarantee high bandwidth low latency connections
between its Paxos slaves.  Doing globally consistent transactions over the
internet intuitively seems infeasible as poor connection quality would increase
the time needed to get consensus.  Furthermore, Google could probably further
increase the performance of their system by further lowering the latency of
their Paxos slave communications using techniques that quantitative trading
firms use to move data across markets quickly.  They probably won't though as
their performance seems adequate for their use case.
