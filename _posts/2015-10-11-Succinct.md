Succinct is really about finding the perfect point in the tradeoff space
between ideal compression, and fast queries.  On one end of this spectrum lies
entirely uncompressed data which  has the fastest queries assuming
memory is infinite.  However, of course, memory isn't infinite and performance
suffers for large datasets which require disk access.  On the other end of the
spectrum is full compression which fits the most data into memory, but
requires decompression to query that data.  Succinct fits happily in the middle.
By foregoing perfect compression for a searchable scheme, they're able to fit
large amounts of data into main memory, without requiring decompression
for complex queries.  This is an obviously useful point in the design space
which will remain influential as long as our data grows faster than memory
costs fall.
