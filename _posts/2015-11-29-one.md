This paper isn't addressing a problem, so much as it's making an observation.
The traditional approach to DBMS architecture, where a single generalized code
base is designed to suit all workloads, had started to break down at the time
the paper was written.  Specifically stream processing does not fit will into
the traditional architecture for various reasons outlined in the paper.  This
observation seems quite insightful, and indeed anticipated the explosion in
stream processing systems we've seen recently.

Their main nugget of wisdom, is that by carefully crafting the system to meet
the needs of the application, significant performance gains are achievable.
This could mean sacrificing ACID guarantees if they aren't necessary, removing
the traditional isolation between clients and the DBMS, or experimenting with
alternative data formats (i.e. column store).  The scale of the challenges in
modern data science are such that a proliferation of database systems are
justified to meet these challenges.
