Consensus algorithms are fundamentally about agreeing on a total order of
events.  CRDTs, on the other hand, recognise that if all events are
commutative, associative, and idempotent, they don't need a total order of
events and can therefore avoid coordination.  The problem with this is that
achieving commutativity and associativity are somewhat unnatural.  One does it
by essentially collecting all changes in an every growing log.  In effect,
you're making a tradeoff between coordination and datastructure efficiency.
Coordination allows you to store an ideal representation of your data, at the
cost of paxos, while CRDTs have no coordination at the cost of inefficient
data structures.  And of course, this paper suggests a midpoint on the spectrum
where they coordinate occasionally to decide on epochs where compaction occurs,
but leaving everything eventually consistent otherwise.

I think the jury is still out on CRDTs.  For them to really take off, someone
needs to build a real system which can show significant advantages from their
use.  My suspicion is that with any complex application, some coordination is
necessary for some behaviors.  The instant you introduce any coordination at
all, the marginal cost of using it for everything (i.e. doing everything
through a leader) is somewhat low.  Therefore the benefit of CRDTs in that case
would be minimal.
