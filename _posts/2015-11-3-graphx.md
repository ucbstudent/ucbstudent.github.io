The GraphX paper builds on top of the PowerGraph papers results to show how to
do big data computations on large Graphs.  PowerGraph observed that
partitioning by edges was better than partitioning by vertex.  GraphX simply
takes this insight and applies it to spark.  This allows them to build a graph
processing system on top of Spark with good performance guarantees.
Furthermore, since it's built on spark one can easily interleave graph
computations and more traditional batch computations.   In effect, the paper
busts the assumption that we need specialized systems for all data processing
tasks.
