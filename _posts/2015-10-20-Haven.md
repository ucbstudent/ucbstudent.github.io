Haven addresses the very real problem of trust between cloud providers and
users.  The popularity of the "hybrid cloud" movement suggests to me that users
are (rightly) distrustful of cloud providers for their most sensitive
information.  To achieve security, the paper suggests use of the proposed SGX
extensions to Intel hardware to create secure enclaves which the hypervisor
cannot access.  Overall this seems like a useful point in the design space
assuming it works out.  It still requires one to trust both Intel CPUs (a big
ask) and windows implemented in LibOS (also a big ask), but it does generally
reduce the threat surface.  That said, if really concerned about security, I'm
not sure public cloud is the right option due to these risks.
