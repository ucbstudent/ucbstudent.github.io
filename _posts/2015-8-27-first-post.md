[CS294](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/classes/cs294/15/) is a graduate
seminar at UC Berkeley covering Big Data systems research.  As a student of
the class, I'll be posting regular reviews/summaries of the
[readings](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/classes/cs294/15/class.html) in
this blog.
