It's entirely unclear to me what the contribution of this work is.  Elastic
search seems like a reasonably competent product implementing many of the
tricks of modern NoSQL databases. I.E. partition the data across a set of
service, and allow clients to query the partitions they need to do a lookup (or
search). It may be a great product, and perhaps a good business, but there
doesn't appear to be anything new here.
