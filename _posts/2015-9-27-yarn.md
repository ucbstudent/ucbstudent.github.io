Apache Yarn is a resource scheduler which appears to be solving-
essentially the same problem as Mesos.  In fact, the contribution over Mesos
seems very thin.  Like Mesos, they realized the it's useful to decouple
workload scheduling and application logic, but sometime later making it hard to
argue this is something new.

I think the key difference is how they actually allocate resources to
applications.  Instead of simply offering resources and expecting applications
to accept or reject them, they allow applications to state a preference which
they attempt to accommodate.  There seems to be somewhat of a tradeoff here,
the Mesos approach is simpler, but is (perhaps) less likely to converge on an
optimal solution, while YARN is significantly more complicated.  Unfortunately,
the paper does a poor job of exploring this trade off.

All considered, YARN seems like a nice engineering effort to bring Mesos-like
benefits to the Hadoop world, though the research contributions are not
convincing.
