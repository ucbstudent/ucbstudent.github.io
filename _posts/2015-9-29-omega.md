Omega is a scheduler developed by Google aiming at high performance scheduling
for very large clusters.  The primary problem they're solving isn't so much
technical as organizational: How do you break your scheduler into small pieces
which can be developed independently but still need to coexist.  Their solution
is straight forward, they keep all scheduling state in a giant shared pool, and
allow various schedulers to update it at will, relying on CPU level atomic
operations to detect conflicts and retry.  All in all, it's a somewhat hacky
less sophisticated version of the optimistic concurrency control database
systems have been using for their transactions forever.  It's probably faster
and works well for their use case, but it isn't terribly interesting.
